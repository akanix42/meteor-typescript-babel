# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] - 2019-05-18
 - Update dependencies; likely only compatible with Meteor 1.8+

## [0.0.10] - 2018-09-06
 - By directly using the Babel Typescript plugin instead of the preset, we no longer receive reify errors.
   As a result, the extra transpilation step has been removed, which greatly simplifies this plugin.

## [0.0.9] - 2018-07-09
 - Update Babel plugins to version 7.0.0-beta.51
 - Support new version of Babel decorators plugin by passing { legacy: true } option

## [0.0.8] - 2018-04-19
 - Add support for `.tsignore` file in project root (using `.gitignore` syntax)
 - Support dynamic import syntax
 - Fix Babel source map issues casued by updates to Meteor Babel package

## [0.0.7] - 2018-03-12
 - Fix decorators not working (#3) - to use decorators please follow the installation and usage instructions here:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators
 - Fix JSX not working (#5) - to use JSX please install and setup your `.babelrc` as usual; as an example, for React
    please follow the installation and usage instructions here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/preset-react

## [0.0.6] - 2018-02-03
 - Fix babel dependencies not being automatically installed (#1)

## [0.0.5] - 2018-01-29
 - Change the output file extension to .js (index.ts -> index.js) to enable directory imports

## [0.0.4] - 2018-01-26
 - Insert a separate compilation step to run before Meteor's babel-compiler. This is where the TypeScript compilation occurs,
   because otherwise reify will throw errors when it tries to parse some TypeScript syntax such as the `as` keyword.
   If the user has @babel/preset-typescript in .babelrc it will no longer have any effect, because the TypeScript preset
   is now being invoked prior to the normal Babel compilation.

## [0.0.3] - 2018-01-25
 - Avoid processing declarations (`d.ts`) files

## [0.0.2] - 2018-01-24
 - Always use the `@babel/preset-typescript` even if it's not included in `.babelrc`

## [0.0.1] - 2018-01-23
 - Initial release
